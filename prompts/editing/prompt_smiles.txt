"**Instructions:**
Analyze the given molecule and the editing instruction below, then generate the SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) for the edited molecule.

- Use the supplied SMILES as the starting structure. Do not change any atoms, bonds, stereochemistry, charges, or isotopes unless the instruction explicitly tells you to.
- Apply the modification exactly once; the instruction is unambiguous.
- Return the resulting SMILES string enclosed within <smiles> and </smiles> tags. 

**Original molecule represented by SMILES:**
`{original_smiles}`
