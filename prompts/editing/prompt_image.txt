**Instructions:**
Analyze the given molecular structure image and the editing instruction below, then generate a new image representing the edited molecule.

-Use the supplied molecule as the starting structure. Do not change any atoms, bonds, stereochemistry, charges, or isotopes unless the instruction explicitly tells you to.
- Apply the modification exactly once; the instruction is unambiguous.
- Return the resulting molecular structure as an image.
