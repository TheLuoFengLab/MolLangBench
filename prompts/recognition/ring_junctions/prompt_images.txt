**Instructions:**
Analyze the given molecule represented as an image to identify all ring junction atoms.

- Atom indices are labeled directly adjacent to each atom in the image.
- Identify ring junction atoms, defined as atoms shared between two or more rings.
- Count the total number of ring junction atoms.
- List the indices of all ring junction atoms.
- Present the result in the following structured format:
  1.  Total number of ring junction atoms: Enclose the integer within <count> and </count>. 
  2. Indices of ring junction atoms: Enclose the list of indices within <atom_indices> and </atom_indices>.
