**Instructions:**  
Analyze the given molecule represented by a SMILES string to identify all ring junction atoms (i.e., atoms that are shared between two or more rings).

- Assign unique indices to all non-hydrogen atoms in the molecule based on their order of appearance in the SMILES string (left to right), starting from 0.  
- Identify ring junction atoms by determining which atoms are shared between at least two rings.  
- Count the total number of ring junction atoms.  
- List the indices of all ring junction atoms.  
- Present the results in the following structured format:  
  1. Total number of ring junction atoms: Enclose the integer within <count> and </count>. 
  2. Indices of ring junction atoms: Enclose the list of indices within <atom_indices> and </atom_indices>.
