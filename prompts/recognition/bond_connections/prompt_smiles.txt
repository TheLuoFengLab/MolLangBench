**Instructions:**
Analyze the given molecule represented by a SMILES string to determine the bond type between two specified atoms.

- Assign unique indices to all non-hydrogen atoms in the molecule based on their order of appearance in the SMILES string (left to right), starting from 0.
- Identify the bond (if any) between the two specified atoms.
- Classify the bond type according to the following rules:
  - No bond: Return `0`
  - Single bond: Return `1`
  - Double bond: Return `2`
  - Triple bond: Return `3`
  - Aromatic bond: Return `12`  
- Return the bond type (0, 1, 2, or 12) in the specified structured format by enclosing it within <bond_type> and </bond_type>.

**SMILES string:** `{smiles}`
**Target atom index 1:** {target_atom_0}
**Target atom index 2:** {target_atom_1}
