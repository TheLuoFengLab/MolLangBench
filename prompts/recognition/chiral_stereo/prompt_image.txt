**Instructions:**
Analyze the given molecule represented as an image to determine the R/S stereochemical configuration of the highlighted atom.

- Determine whether the atom is a chiral center and classify it using the following rules:
  - `0`: Not a chiral center or no defined stereochemistry
  - `1`: R (rectus / clockwise)  
  - `2`: S (sinister / counterclockwise)
- Present the stereochemical type as an integer enclosed within <chiral_stereo> and </chiral_stereo>.
