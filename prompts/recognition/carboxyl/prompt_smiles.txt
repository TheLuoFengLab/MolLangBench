**Instructions:**  
Analyze the given molecule represented by a SMILES string to determine the total number of carboxyl functional groups present in the molecule.

- Assign unique indices to all non-hydrogen atoms in the molecule based on their order of appearance in the SMILES string (left to right), starting from 0.
- Identify carboxyl group, defined as a carbonyl (C=O) group directly bonded to a hydroxyl (-OH) group, corresponding to the substructure `C(=O)O`.
- Count the total number of carboxyl groups.
- For each carboxyl group, provide the indices of the carbon (C) and two oxygen (O) atoms forming the group. Do not include the hydrogen index since the hydrogen may be omitted in the SMILES string.
- Present the results in the following structured format:
  1. Total number of carboxyl groups: Enclose this integer within <count> and </count>.   
  2. Indices of carboxyl group atoms: Enclose the list of atom indices for each carboxyl group within <atom_indices> and </atom_indices>. Each group should be represented as a separate list of three indices. 
- For example, if two carboxyl groups are found, the output should be formatted as follows:
  1. <count>2</count> 
  2. <atom_indices> [1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6] </atom_indices>
