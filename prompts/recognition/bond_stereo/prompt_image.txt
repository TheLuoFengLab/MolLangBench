**Instructions:**
Analyze the given molecule represented as an image to determine the E/Z stereochemical configuration of the double bond between the two highlighted atoms.

- Determine the stereochemistry of the double bond according to the following rules:
  - `1`: E (entgegen / trans)
  - `2`: Z (zusammen / cis) 
- Present the bond stereochemical type as an integer enclosed within <bond_stereo> and </bond_stereo>.
