**Instructions:**
Analyze the given molecule represented by a SMILES string to determine the E/Z stereochemical configuration of the double bond between the two specified atoms.

- Assign unique indices to all non-hydrogen atoms in the molecule based on their order of appearance in the SMILES string (left to right), starting from 0.
- Locate the double bond connecting the two specified atoms.
- Determine the stereochemistry of the double bond according to the following rules:
  - `1`: E (entgegen / trans)
  - `2`: Z (zusammen / cis)
- Return the bond stereochemical type (1 or 2) in the specified structured format by enclosing it within <bond_stereo> and </bond_stereo>.

**SMILES string:** `{smiles}`
**Target atom index 1:** {target_atom_0}
**Target atom index 2:** {target_atom_1}
