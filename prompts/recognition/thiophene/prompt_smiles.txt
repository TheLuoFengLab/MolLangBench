**Instructions:**  
Analyze the given molecule represented by a SMILES string to determine the total number of thiophenes present in the molecule.

- Assign unique indices to all non-hydrogen atoms in the molecule based on their order of appearance in the SMILES string (left to right), starting from 0.
- Identify thiophene rings, defined as five-membered aromatic rings containing one sulfur atom and four carbon atoms, corresponding to the substructure `s1cccc1`.
- Count the total number of thiophenes.
- For each thiophene ring, provide the indices of the five atoms forming the ring.
- Present the results in the following structured format:
  1. Total number of thiophene rings: Enclose this integer within <count> and </count>. 
  2. Indices of thiophene ring atoms: Enclose the list of atom indices for each thiophene ring within <atom_indices> and </atom_indices>. Each ring should be represented as a separate list of five indices. 
- For example, if two thiophene rings are found, the output should be formatted as follows:
  1. <count>2</count>
  2. <atom_indices> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9, 10] </atom_indices>
