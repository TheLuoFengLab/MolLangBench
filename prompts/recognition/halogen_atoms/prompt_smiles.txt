**Instructions:**  
Analyze the given molecule represented by a SMILES string to determine the total number of halogen atoms in the molecule.

- Assign unique indices to all non-hydrogen atoms in the molecule based on their order of appearance in the SMILES string (left to right), starting from 0.
- Identify halogen atoms, including the elements fluorine (F), chlorine (Cl), bromine (Br), and iodine (I).
- Count the total number of halogens.
- Provide the indices of all halogen atoms.
- Present the results in the following structured format:
  1. Total number of halogen atoms: Enclose this integer within <count> and </count>. 
  2. Indices of halogen atoms: Enclose the list of halogen atom indices <atom_indices> and </atom_indices>.
