**Instructions:**
Analyze the given molecule represented as an image to determine the total number of halogen atoms present in the molecule.

- Atom indices are labeled directly adjacent to each atom in the image.
- Identify halogen atoms, including the elements fluorine (F), chlorine (Cl), bromine (Br), and iodine (I).
- Count the total number of halogens.
- Provide the indices of all halogen atoms.
- Present the results in the following structured format:
  1. Total number of halogen atoms: Enclose this integer within <count> and </count>. 
  2. Indices of halogen atoms: Enclose the list of halogen atom indices <atom_indices> and </atom_indices>.
