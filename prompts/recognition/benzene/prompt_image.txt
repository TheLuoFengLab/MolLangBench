**Instructions:**  
Analyze the given molecule represented as an image to determine the total number of benzene rings present in the molecule.

- Atom indices are labeled directly adjacent to each atom in the image.
- Identify benzene rings, defined as six-membered aromatic rings, corresponding to the substructure `c1ccccc1`.
- Count the total number of benzene rings.
- For each benzene ring, provide the indices of the six atoms forming the ring.
- Present the results in the following structured format:
  1. Total number of benzene rings: Enclose this integer within <count> and </count>. 
  2. Indices of benzene ring atoms: Enclose the list of atom indices for each benzene ring within <atom_indices> and </atom_indices>. Each ring should be represented as a separate list of six indices. 
- For example, if two benzene rings are found, the output should be formatted as follows:
  1. <count>2</count> 
  2. <atom_indices> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12] </atom_indices>
