**Instructions:**  
Analyze the given molecule represented as an image to determine the total number of furans present in the molecule.

- Atom indices are labeled directly adjacent to each atom in the image.
- Identify furan rings, defined as five-membered aromatic rings containing one oxygen atom and four carbon atoms, corresponding to the substructure `o1cccc1`.
- Count the total number of furans.
- For each furan ring, provide the indices of the five atoms forming the ring.
- Present the results in the following structured format:
  1. Total number of furan rings: Enclose this integer within <count> and </count>. 
  2. Indices of furan ring atoms: Enclose the list of atom indices for each furan ring within <atom_indices> and </atom_indices>. Each ring should be represented as a separate list of five indices. 
- For example, if two furan rings are found, the output should be formatted as follows:
  1. <count>2</count>
  2. <atom_indices> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9, 10] </atom_indices>
