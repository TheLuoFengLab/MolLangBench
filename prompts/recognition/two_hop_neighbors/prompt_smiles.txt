**Instructions:**
Analyze the given molecule represented by a SMILES string to identify all atoms that are exactly two bonds away (2-hop neighbors) from a specified atom.

- Assign unique indices to all non-hydrogen atoms in the molecule based on their order of appearance in the SMILES string (left to right), starting from 0.
- Identify the atom at the specified index.
- Determine which atoms lie exactly two bonds away (smallest path distance of 2) from the specified atom.
- Present the results in the following structured format:
  1. Number of 2-hop neighbors: Enclose this integer within <count> and </count>.
  2. Indices of the 2-hop neighbors: Enclose the list of these indices within <atom_indices> and </atom_indices>.
  
**SMILES string:** `{smiles}`
**Target atom index:** {target_atom}
