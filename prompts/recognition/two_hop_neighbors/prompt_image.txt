**Instructions:**
Analyze the given molecule represented as an image to identify all atoms are exactly two bonds away (2-hop neighbors) from the highlighted atom.

- Atom indices are labeled directly adjacent to each atom in the image.
- Identify the highlighted atom.
- Determine which atoms lie exactly two bonds away (smallest path distance of 2) from the highlighted atom.
- Present the results in the following structured format:
  1. Number of 2-hop neighbors: Enclose this integer within <count> and </count>.
  2. Indices of the 2-hop neighbors: Enclose the list of these indices within <atom_indices> and </atom_indices>.
